## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to U.S. elections, including topics such as online misinformation, voting demographics, and voter turnout. I'm especially interested in examining voter turnout in states which have passed restrictive voting laws in the aftermath of the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court case, which found Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, allowing states to pass voting laws without being subject to federal review. Restrictive laws include restrictions on mail voting and unreasonably strict voter ID requirements, which disproportionately impact voters of color. These sorts of laws have been adopted by 29 states to date (https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/states-have-added-nearly-100-restrictive-laws-scotus-gutted-voting-rights).
